# Food Trucks Near Me

This was the code for [Food Trucks Near Me](http://foodtrucksnearme.com), a project by [Philip Thomas](http://philipithomas.com) during Summer 2012. It aimed to provide a dashboard of food trucks in cities by aggregating the twitter feeds and menus of local trucks. It featured the cities Saint Louis, Kansas City, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Chicago. The site was [popular](http://www.philipithomas.com/food-truck-stl-on-fox-2-news-in-the-morning/) in all cities.

Due to [deprecations in the Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/api-v1-is-retired), the site code (based on rendering updates clientside with JQuery) ceased to function. Hence, the site was taken offline in June 2013.
